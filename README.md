# Chill Lounge

## Introduction
Welcome to Chill Lounge, a personalized self-care guide inspired by [youfeellikeshit.com](https://youfeellikeshit.com/). It is a single-page application built with React App and with implementation of Hooks and Redux.

## Features
Chill Lounge has 3 main features:
  1. Guide - contains 5 sets of questions; each subsequent question is dynamically rendered based on user input
  2. Wellness Report - shows the results of user inputs; each set of result contains 4 wellness indicators (eat/sleep/exercise/mood) and can be filtered by date
  3. Message Board - contains all message cards generated by user; user can also search or filter specific cards

User Authentication:<br/>
When the page loads, a new user will be asked to sign up, while previously logged-in user will be re-directed to the Guide page.

External API calls:<br/>
When the user completes the guide, s/he can choose to claim a free cocktail, which triggers the app to fetch a random cocktail image and a random life advice slip, generating a new card belonging to the user. 

The user can then keep clicking on "hit me with another cocktail/message" to re-generate new cocktail images and/or life advice. 

When the user clicks "post it to message board", s/he will be redirected to Message Board page with their newly-created cards shown on top.
